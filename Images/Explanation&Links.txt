# The first two images were out attempt at a visual representation of all relationships between all players
# [Un]fortuneately, we had many, many data points so we had to turncate it to 250,000 edges between the ~23,000 nodes
# As can be seen, it is somewhate unreadable

# 1-1 = 22,138 players plotted (randomly assigned each time the image was generated)
# 1-2 = 1,495,723 player relationships plotted
	## relationship defined as player playing on the same team as someone else
	## admittedly, the set does not account for the tuples being undirected
		### i.e. it (1,2) would not be repeated, but it might coexist with (2,1)

# Our next idea was to organize the data so that we could make something of it
	## i.e. actually distinguish between lines and space
	## and... you know, not have it crash

# x=year(beginning of career), y=team(arbitrary value assigned), z=player(arbitrary value assigned)
# we then mapped the jumps between teams that a plyer made during their career

# 2-2 = 22,138 players across 122 teams spanning plotted based on criteria above
# 2-3 = ~23,000 career jumps plotted, changing the x and y paremter, but not the z
